Draft Kings daily fantasy baseball lineup optimizer

Steps
1. Update date on `constants.js` to desired date in the format `MM-DD` such as `06-02` for June 2.
2. Optional - Update team stats by running `node getTeamBattingStats.js`
3. `npm run start` to fetch days games, lineups, current player stats
4. Go to draftkings.com, open desired contest, `export` csv of players, move to './fixtures' and rename as 'salaries_(date)' (matching date from step 1)
5. Run `npm run generate` to generate optimal lineup, or `npm run team` to generate team-stacked lineup with 5 batters from same team
6. Enter lineup on draftkings and collect profits

Note:
This program grabs the actual lineups for each game, which are not available until < 3 hours from first pitch. Therefore, do not grab data until lineups are set [here](https://www.fangraphs.com/livescoreboard.aspx)
